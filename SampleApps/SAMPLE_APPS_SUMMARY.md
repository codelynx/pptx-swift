# PPTX Viewer Sample Apps - Summary

## What's Been Created

### 🎯 Complete Sample Applications

We've created two fully functional sample applications that demonstrate PPTXKit:

1. **PPTXViewer-iOS** - Universal iOS app for iPhone and iPad
2. **PPTXViewer-macOS** - Native macOS application

### 📁 Project Structure

```

├── generate_multiplatform_project.swift # Script to regenerate project

### 🚀 Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Use Pre-generated Project (Fastest!)
```bash
cd SampleApps
open PPTXViewer.xcodeproj  # It's already there!
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (2 minutes)
- Create new Xcode project
- Add PPTXKit dependency
- Copy source files

### 🔧 How the Project Generators Work

The `generate_multiplatform_project.swift` script:
1. Creates a single `.xcodeproj` bundle with multiple targets
2. Configures both iOS and macOS targets in one project
3. Shares PPTXKit dependency between platforms
4. Sets up proper build configurations for each platform
5. Creates shared schemes for easy target switching

The project is pre-generated and ready to use, but you can regenerate it anytime if needed.

### ✨ Features Demonstrated

**iOS App:**
- Document browser integration
- Tab-based interface (Presentation/Thumbnails/Info)
- Touch gestures for navigation
- Security-scoped resource handling
- Universal app supporting all iOS devices

**macOS App:**
- Native menu bar and keyboard shortcuts
- Split view with sidebar
- Three view modes (Presentation/Thumbnails/Outline)
- Search functionality
- Window management

**Both Apps:**
- PPTXManager for state management
- File picker integration
- Error handling
- High-quality rendering
- Navigation controls

### 🛠 Technical Details

The generated Xcode projects include:
- Minimum deployment targets (iOS 14.0, macOS 12.0)
- Swift 5.0 language version
- Local package dependency configuration
- Proper Info.plist settings
- Document type associations

### 📚 Documentation

- **README.md** - Overview and quick start
- **QUICK_START.md** - Detailed setup instructions
- **XCODE_SETUP.md** - Manual project creation guide
- **FILE_STRUCTURE.md** - What's included and why

### 🎓 Why This Approach?

1. **Flexibility** - Developers can use generated projects or create their own
2. **Education** - Source code shows best practices
3. **Maintainability** - Script can be updated as needed
4. **Compatibility** - Works with any Xcode version

### 🔮 Next Steps

Developers can:
1. Run the apps immediately with generated projects
2. Customize the UI and features
3. Learn from the implementation
4. Build their own apps using PPTXKit

The sample apps provide a complete foundation for building PowerPoint viewers on Apple platforms!
